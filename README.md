SNHU CS255 - System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The DriverPass project was for a client who wanted to create a cloud-based online portal for client seeking to gain a drivers license. Their cloud based system would include ways for their customers to pay and enroll in driving classes, both online training and supervised drives. 

What did you do particularly well?
  Throughout the project, I felt I conveyed the requirements through the various UML diagrams very well. A lot of attention was put into ensuring a clean and clear presentation for the client. From the diagrams themselves, the client should gain a solid understanding of the system/subsystem described.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would go back and review the initial requirements documentation. After spending a few weeks working through the system, there are a few areas I would revise or update in the functional and non-functional requirements list to better capture the needs of the client. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  With any public facing application, the end users experience must be enjoyable and intuitive. Understanding the goals of the company (DriverPass), and implementing best practices for the design was key for creating a good user experience. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  Diving into the different system diagrams this term was very helpful in understanding different ways to approach system design. Understanding the strengths of each diagram and the use cases for each really gave me a good foundation to better plan a system. I see the lessons of this class as expanding my tool box. I may not use every tool every time, but the more tools I have the broader range of problems I can tackle.
